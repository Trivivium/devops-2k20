# Development Report
This document is the final report of Group b (2k20 MSc) for the *DevOps, Software
Evolution and Software Maintenance* course at IT University of Copenhagen, held in spring 2020.
It will detail the process of migrating the Minitwit platform, refactoring of the system,
major devops tasks we have done throughout the course, our team and repository organization and strategies.
Report is divided by sections, not by the timeline, so the reader can get better overview of our work.
We also argued for the choice of technologies and decisions we had made. At the end of the document,
we give a summary of what were our biggest issues and challenges, what we have learned out of that and what could have done better.
